## Introduction

Welcome to the development guide for the SwiftUI Package of DB UX Design System!
This document outlines the development concepts and practices for this
framework, helping new developers get up to speed and contribute efficiently.

## Project Overview

This SwiftUI-based UX Design System Framework aims to:

* Define design elements such as colors, typography, and spacing as tokens.
* Provide pre-built UI components like buttons, alerts, and chips.

The framework is designed to be user-friendly, leveraging SwiftUI for a modern
and maintainable codebase. The project is offered as a Swift Package for easy
integration.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture follows a modular approach and is organized into the following
key components:

* **Foundation:** Central definition of design elements including colors,
  typography and spacing.
* **Components:** Essential UI components built with SwiftUI, such as buttons,
  alerts and chips.

## ADRs

Significant architectural decisions are documented in Architecture Decision
Records (ADRs). These records ensure transparency and consistency throughout the
project. Developers are encouraged to document new decisions as ADRs to maintain
project integrity.

* All ADRs are located in the `docs/adr` directory of the repository.
* [Refer to ADR Documentation](./docs/adr)

## Implementation Guidelines

To ensure high standards of code quality and consistency, adhere to the
following guidelines:

1. **Code Structure:**
    * Organize files by feature or module.
    * Follow the Swift API Design Guidelines.
2. **Components:**
    * Build UI components using SwiftUI.
    * Ensure components are reusable and customizable via modifiers.
3. **Design Tokens Usage:**
    * Consistently apply design tokens across all components.
4. **Documentation:**
    * Document all public APIs thoroughly.
    * Include inline comments for complex logic.

## Code Quality

Maintaining high code quality is crucial. Follow these best practices:

1. **Code Reviews:** All code changes must undergo a rigorous review process.
2. **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all critical functionalities.
3. **Linting:** Use SwiftLint to enforce a consistent code style.
4. **CI Pipeline:** Implement automated testing and linting for every pull
   request.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community! For details on how to contribute to
this project, refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. It includes information on
how to report issues, submit pull requests, and follow coding standards.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    * `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/design-system-framework-swiftui.git`

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    * `cd design-system-framework-swiftui`

3. **Open the Project in Xcode:**
    * Open the project folder in Xcode:
        * Command line: `xed .`
        * Finder: Right-click the project folder and select "Open with Xcode"

4. **Resolve Dependencies:**
    * Xcode should automatically resolve and fetch dependencies when you open
      the project.

5. **Run Tests:**
    * Ensure all tests pass by selecting `Product > Test` from the menu or using
      the shortcut (`Cmd + U`).

Thank you for contributing to this project! Together, we can develop a robust
and versatile DB UX Design System using SwiftUI.
